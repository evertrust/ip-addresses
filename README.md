# EVERTRUST IP addresses

This repository is automatically updated with EVERTRUST's CIDR ranges for whitelisting purposes. Each line represents a valid CIDR range according to [RFC 4632](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4632).

The latest version is available at all times at: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evertrust/ip-addresses/main/values.yaml.

We recommend pulling this database every day, as we may add or remove addresses with a 48h interval.
